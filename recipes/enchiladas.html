            Description
        </h2>

        This is a recipe for enchiladas! <em>But the picture is a lie!</em> <strong>A lie, I tell you!</strong> I got it from wikipedia, and it is of enchiladas with corn tortillas. The recipe uses flour tortillas. <br>
        The picture is out of copyright, so I am using it instead.

            Steps
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook chicken, however you like, and shred it.</li>
            <li>Spray or grease casserole pan.</li>
            <li>Coat bottom of casserole pan thinly with some of the enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>Roll out wax paper to lay out all the tortillas at one time.</li>
            <li>Top each tortilla with about 3 tablespoons of enchilada sauce to cover to within about 1/2 inch from edge.</li>
            <li>Lay a line of shredded chicken across the diameter of the tortilla to about 1/2 inch of edge.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle cheese along the chicken and then chopped green onions along the line.</li>
            <li>Roll the tortillas (without bothering to tuck the ends) and line them in the casserole dish, seam down.</li>
            <li>Pour the rest of the sauce over the enchiladas in the pan (usually at least a whole can) trying to cover thoroughly so they don't dry out.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle any remaining cheese and green onions over the top of the casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Cover with foil for all or most of the baking time.</li>
        </ol>
