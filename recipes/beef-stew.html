            Old-Time Beef Stew</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        A simple, class beef stew recipe.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1-2 lbs. beef chuck (or round steak or other), cut in 1 to 1-1/2 inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 cups of beef bouillon (or 2 cups water with about 3 teaspoons beef bouillon granules or 3 cubes)</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 or 2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>Dash ground allspice or cloves</li>
            <li>6 carrots, pared and quartered</li>
            <li>4 potatoes, pared and quartered</li>
            <li>1 lb. small white onions (I usually just cut 2 medium onions into chunks)</li>
            <li>Gravy</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <h4>Stew</h4>
        <ol>

        <li>In Dutch oven, thoroughly brown meat in 2 tablespoons hot oil or shortening, turning often.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups beef bouillion and next 8 ingredients (through the dash of allspice or cloves).</li>
        <li>Cover; simmer for 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to keep from sticking.</li>
        <li>Remove bay leaves.  Add vegetables.  Cover and cook 30-45 minutes, or till vegetables are tender.</li>

        </ol>
            
        Serves 6-8.  Note:  I usually only brown the meat on the stove top.  I put the covered Dutch oven in the oven at about 325-350 and do the rest of the cooking in there, following the approximate times shown above.
         
        <h4>Gravy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup beef bouillion</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons flour</li>
        
        </ul>

        <ol>
            
            <li>Whisk flour into beef bouillon.</li>
            <li>Add all to beef stew and mix with liquid still in stew.</li>
             
        </ol>
         
        Basic mixture for gravy is 2 tablespoons flour to 1 cup liquid so I add flour based on the amount of liquid left in the stew.  The main thing is to whisk the flour in the bouillon/water before adding to the hot stew, otherwise you get lumps.
           
        Beef bouillon in cans is cumbersome so I always use granules and water.  I'm generous with the granules -- 1+ or 2 teaspoons to a cup of water.  I'm always generous with the amount of vegetables too.
